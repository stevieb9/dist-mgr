=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution is for my personal development cycle. At this time, is relies
on using L<Module::Starter> for initial distribution creation, Github for
repository and bugtracker, and the L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> build system, which
utilizes C<Makefile.PL> files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dist::Mgr qw(:all)

    my $results = version_bump('2.02');

    my $file_versions = version_info();

=head1 EXPORT_OK

We do not automatically import anything into your namespace, you must request
functionality explicitly. Use the C<:all> tag, or have a peruse through the
L</FUNCTIONS> section for what's available.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

    $author

I<Mandatory, String>: The Github username of the software author. For example,
mine is C<stevieb9>.

I<Mandatory, String>: The name of the repository. For example, the repository
name for this distribution is C<dist-mgr>.

default to C<./Makefile.PL>.

I<Returns>: C<0> upon success.

I<Parameters>:

    $version

I<Mandatory, String>: The new version to update to.

=head3 Dry run mode

The C<$version> parameter can be prepended with an optional dash (C<->), and if

have written to any files. Eg: C<version_bump('-1.01')>.

    $fs_entry

I<Optional, String>: The directory or file to operate on. If a directory is
