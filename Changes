Revision history for STEVEB-Dist-Mgr

1.00 UNREL
        - Fix issue where ABSTRACT was being pulled from one of the test
          modules. We now pull it from the proper POD file (fixes #4)
        - t/20-ci_config_files.t no longer overwrites this distribution's
          production CI config file (fixes #3)
        - Commented out package statement in test module template so it doesn't
          get indexed on the CPAN (fixes #7)
        - Renamed all instances of Acme::STEVEB and Acme-STEVEB with
          Test::Module and Test-Module
        - We now send in all of the proper variables to the module template
          (fixes #11)
        - Renamed _makefile_load() and _module_load() to _makefile_tie() and
          _module_tie(), which are by far more appropriate names
        - CI config now installs ExtUtils::MakeMaker to a recent version,
          fixing an issue where prereqs weren't being installed (fixes #9)
